# ShabdSetuâ€“ Dying Dialects Dilemma

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

ShadbdSetu is aÂ **gamified Indian language learning and dialect preservation platform** built by Team BisiGitBaath. The project addresses two major issues:

1. **Lack of interactive tools** for learning Indian languages with pronunciation and conversational practice.
2. **Dying dialects** â€“ many Indian dialects are disappearing rapidly due to lack of documentation and oral-only traditions.

Our mission is to combine **learning with preservation**, enabling users to not only learn Indian languages but also actively participate in documenting and safeguarding their native dialects.
